# pythonCreating a simple sign up view and then moving onto more advanced sign up view with profile model and confirmation mail

I have also added a location field in custom profile model and stored the actual location (city, country code) of user using API, a little javascript and python without letting user know about it. For a tutorial on using that API checkout my repo

In this tutorial we will

Create basic sign up view
Create sign up form with extra fields
Create profile model for users
Create sign up view with confirmation email
